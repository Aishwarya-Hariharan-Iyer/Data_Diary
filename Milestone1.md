**Let us step into SPRINT 2!**

🎬 **Step 1: Choose Your Movie Data**🍿
- Pick a dataset that excites you! 🤩 It could be about movies, books, food, or anything else for recommendations. For example, I plan to use use resources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meastanmay/imdb-dataset) or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nbtpj/Movies_and_TV).
- Make sure your dataset includes additional info about the movies, like genres and endings. These are the "features" we'll use for recommendations.

📊 **Step 2: Data Visualization** 📈
- Dive into your data using an IDE and create cool visualizations with interactive charts using the Dash framework. 📉 You can use this Dash resource: [Dash by Plotly](https://dash.plotly.com/).
- Create at least three awesome visualizations from your chosen dataset and think about how they can help with recommendations.

🚀 **Step 3: Git and Dashboard** 📦
- Start a Git branch with the name "dashboard_datasetname" and commit your code! 🧑‍💻 Here's a quick GitHub resource: [Hello World - GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).
- Share screenshots of your dazzling dashboard to showcase your work. 📸

🤖 **Step 4: Dive into Machine Learning** 🤖
- Now, let's get into the ML part. First, preprocess the data: remove missing values, convert strings to numbers, and make the data useful. 🧹 Check out this resource for preprocessing: [Scikit-Learn Preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html).

_There is a secret however...._
- Discover cool tools and options for automatic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization, and update your dashboard with these insights.
- Utilize resources like [AutoClean](https://github.com/elisemercury/AutoClean) for automated data preprocessing.

🎉** Milestone Celebrations** 🥳
- If you've made it this far, congrats! 🎈 Next week, you'll explore HuggingFace models and GitHub recommendation models to get a feel for the process.
- Think about adding a unique feature to your system, like considering user reviews for movie recommendations.
- Experiment with building your recommendation model using Scikit-Learn and AutoML, and integrate it into your dashboard.
- Add beautiful visualizations and interactive user experiences to make your system shine! ✨

🌐 _**Coming Soon: Cross-Domain Recommendations**_ 🌍
- In the future, you can merge your recommendation models with others to build cross-domain recommendation systems. Exciting things ahead! 🌟

Enjoy your movie recommendation project, and have fun exploring the world of data and machine learning! 🍿📊🤖🎉🌟
